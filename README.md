My goal is to get some PCBs from OSH Park and populate with parts based on a BoM I create with the [Kicad_to_Octopart_BOM_csv tool](https://github.com/BitKnitting/Kicad_to_Octopart_BOM_csv) .

# Changes to Power Systems
I am refering to the place on the power schematic that is labeled Power Systems (5V).  I only need 3.3V and do not need battery backup.  

There are two DC power lines:  
* +3.3V - power to the CPU.
* +3.3V_ISO - power to the meter obtained by using U5 (DC-DC isolator) to get the isolated power for the meter.

Tisham's schematic has a Power Systems section that I deleted.  Because:
* Nothing needs 5V power.
* I do not need/want battery backup.
## Deleted parts
Deleted parts include:
* U1 (PN=MCP73831T-3ACI/OT)
* C5,C8,C6,C7,C4,C9 (1ÂµF)
* R32 (2K)
* R33 (1K)
* D1 (PMEG1020EA)

__CONCERN__:  Tisham notes below: x2 _2x1117 series LDO for generating 3.3v from 5V input to clean up SMPS noise_.  
__POR__: Removed LDOs.  Added a 1uF C between VDC+/-

## Changes to Power Systems(5V)
I took out the components used for the battery.  I left in the (5V -> 3.3V) so that the LDO can clean up noise coming out of the SMPS.

### U5
U5 isolates the 3.3V that came off U4 into 3.3V for the CPU and the other 3.3V for the ATM meters.  The one Tisham is using (ROE-0505S) inputs 5V and outputs 5V.  I changed this to the [RNM-3.33.3S](https://datasheet.octopart.com/RNM-3.33.3S-Recom-Power-datasheet-17725523.pdf).

# Changes to current sampling
The schematic supports 8 current clamps.  I need only two.
## Keep
* IA1+ / IA1-
* IB1+ / IB1-
## Delete
The rest.
* The unused 5.8R - R3,R4,R10,R11,R20,R21,R18,R19,R30,R31,R29,R28.
* The unused J3 connector.
* J5 - the 8 pin connector.  I replaced with a 2 3.5mm TRS audio jacks since this is the connection used by CTs.  These are currently labeled J3 and J4.  I find I get confused on how to wire up a TRS audio jack. So I like to keep an image around.

The [datasheet for the TRS part (SJ-3523-SMT-TR)](https://www.cui.com/product/resource/sj-352x-smt-series.pdf) shows what the part looks like in it's schematic form.

# Added LED
Added an LED and R at the SMPS 3.3V output to indicate whether the 3.3V is indeed there.
# From 0603 to 0805
I have standardized on the 0805 package size for Rs and Cs.  I have these in stock.  It is a happier experience to solder with the bigger footprint.

I kept the 5.8 ohm at 0603 because of challenges with availability.

I changed R24, R26, R27 to the 0805 footprint.
